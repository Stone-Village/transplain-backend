        body: '<h3>Different methods of binding</h3><p>There are a few different methods of binding and choosing the one that is best for you is important.</p> <span></span><p>It is important to note that not all methods of binding will work for everyone. Some binding methods may not work for larger chested bodies while others will not work for smaller chested bodies.</p> <ul><li><b>Commercial chest binders –</b> These are specially designed tops that are meant to compress the chest and give a flatter appearance. They are the most common method of chest binding and are good for both small and large chested bodies.</li><li><b>Kinetic tape –</b> Kinetic tape is a body safe adhesive tape used to pull and stretch the breast tissue and fat in a way that gives a flatter appearance. Kinetic tape is good for small and large chested bodies. Larger chested bodies will need to use more tape than smaller chested ones. </li><li><b> Sports tops and sports bras –  </b>These are a cheaper alternative to a chest binder, however they may not offer as flat of an appearance. Some people will layer them as well, but layering is not recommended due to health and safety concerns. This method could be suitable for large chested bodies depending on the type of sports top/bra you purchase and works for smaller chested bodies as well. </li><li><b>Compression tops – <b>Compression tops are an all round compression clothing item. The compression is not like that of a binder or sports top/bra. It is better suited for those with a smaller chest as compression tops will highlight any rises in the body if worn by itself without a layer of clothing on top of it.</li><li><b>Layering clothing –</b> Layering clothes or wearing particularly baggy clothing is not necessarily binding, moreso it is hiding. Layering clothing is not suited for large chested bodies, this method works best on small chested bodies.</li></ul><h3>How do you know what type of binder to pick?<h3><p>There are lots of different brands that supply binders. It is recommended to do research into different brands and find the one that works for you! </p><span></span><p>Making sure that you fit your binder is the most important thing. If you buy a binder that is too tight you run the risk of breathing problems, skin irritation, discomfort and pain or even damage to your ribs and your lungs. Yet if you buy one that is too large, you will not get the desired effect of the product. </p><span></span><p>Make sure to get your measurements and double check them. It\'s best to have someone else measure you to avoid any incorrect measurements. Always check the vendor size guide and make sure your measurements are correct.</p><span></span><p>No body is the same! So not every measurement will match what the vendor provides on a measurement guide. If the seller you are ordering from does not have a binder that fits your proportions perfectly, it is recommended to compare to other sellers to make sure that you can have a binder that fits you the best! If it comes down to it that you may need to order a size up or a size down, it is best to order up! Ordering a size down could cause a lot more problems for you than ordering a size up. Your most important measurements will be your shoulders and side of your bust.</p><span></span><p>Do not buy a binder with snaps or clips as a means of tightening or wearing. These binders are known to be weak in support, cause back problems, skin irritation and rashes. It is highly recommended to buy a binder that does not unclip or have snaps.</p><span></span><h3>What to do and not to do while wearing a binder.<h3><p>A binder is a unit of clothing meant to constrict the chest. This comes with its price however.</p><span></span><p>While wearing a binder you should not wear one for more than 8 hours a day. Wearing a binder for long durations of time has an increased chance of causing bruised ribs, lung damage, back pain, shoulder pain or posture issues.</p><span></span><p>While wearing a binder you should not be doing strenuous or physical activities. Which includes but is not limited to, running, working out, heavy lifting. Any sort of medium to hard physical labor or strenuous tasks/activities may cause injury such as bruised ribs, lung damage, back pain and shoulder pain. If you are going to do physical activities it is recommended to wear a binder that is less constricting as to avoid health concerns or not wearing one at all. Only you can determine your limits while wearing a binder however.</p><span></span><p>Do not wear a binder every day. Wearing a binder everyday reduces your body\'s and lung\'s ability to relax. It is important to give your body 2 to 3 days out of the week without binding so that your lungs are given time to rest and breathe at a normal capacity and to allow your body to rest its shoulders and back without constriction.</p><span></span><p>Here is a list of side effects commonly associated with binding incorrectly</p><ul><li>Chest pain</li><li>Back pain</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Bruising of the ribs</li><li>itching / skin irritation</li><li>Poor posture</li><li>Overheating</li></il><span></span><p>It is recommended that if you are going to be binding regularly that you should ask your doctor or healthcare provider about ways to care for your body and methods of precaution while wearing a binder.</p>',
